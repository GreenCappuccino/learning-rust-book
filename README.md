I've finished reading [the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book) (2021 edition).

This is my code written (or copied) while reading it.

It's fairly close to what is published, deviating slightly where I see fit.

I've decided to ignore creating some projects (and instead run some of the examples directly in the book instead).

The most relevant packages are probaby the projects:
- An I/O Project: Building a Command Line Program (`minigrep/`)
- Final Project: Building a Multithreaded Web Server (`hello/`)
